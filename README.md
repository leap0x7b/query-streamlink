# query-streamlink
A Python webapp that is destined to spit out links given by all sources supported by Streamlink.

## How it works :

This program works by asking Streamlink, based on the base URL you're giving him, a streamable URL.

## Different queries available :

streaming-ip (mandatory) : The URL of the stream you need the link to.

quality (optional) : The streaming quality you want to watch in. No quality specified results in automatically choosing the best quality available for this stream.

## Thank yous :

The IPTV peepz that were involved in making this possible (special thanks to Nintendocustom / Dum4G)

The testers

The Streamlink members and contributors for this amazing tool that is.
